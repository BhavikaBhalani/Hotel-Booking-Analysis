#Project Summary -
This Hotel Booking Analysis EDA delves into understanding cancellation patterns and proposes strategies to minimize cancellations and enhance revenue.

The investigation encompasses booking data from both a city hotel and a resort hotel, including details such as booking dates, length of stay, and guest demographics. The process involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations to discern patterns and insights.

Throughout the project, potential measures to mitigate cancellations and boost revenue are explored. For instance, offering early booking discounts, incentives for longer stays, or exclusive perks for direct bookings could be effective strategies.

The EDA process unfolds in three main phases: exploration and inspection of raw data, addressing data impurities by handling null values and removing irrelevant entries, and conducting analyses including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate examinations.

Ultimately, the project emphasizes that by scrutinizing hotel booking data and comprehending cancellation trends, hotels can enact proactive measures to minimize cancellations and optimize revenue streams.

#Problem Statement
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.

#Define Your Business Objective?
Establishing the business objective involves gaining valuable insights into customer booking behavior within the hotel industry. Recognizing that customer demand can vary across different segments, forecasting becomes challenging, potentially necessitating distinct models for each segment. These insights serve to inform hotels in refining their customer strategies and preparing for uncertainties ahead.
