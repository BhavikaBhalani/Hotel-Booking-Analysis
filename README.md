#Project Summary -
This Hotel Booking Analysis EDA delves into understanding cancellation patterns and proposes strategies to minimize cancellations and enhance revenue.

The investigation encompasses booking data from both a city hotel and a resort hotel, including details such as booking dates, length of stay, and guest demographics. The process involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations to discern patterns and insights.

Throughout the project, potential measures to mitigate cancellations and boost revenue are explored. For instance, offering early booking discounts, incentives for longer stays, or exclusive perks for direct bookings could be effective strategies.

The EDA process unfolds in three main phases: exploration and inspection of raw data, addressing data impurities by handling null values and removing irrelevant entries, and conducting analyses including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate examinations.

Ultimately, the project emphasizes that by scrutinizing hotel booking data and comprehending cancellation trends, hotels can enact proactive measures to minimize cancellations and optimize revenue streams.

#Problem Statement
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.

#Define Your Business Objective?
Establishing the business objective involves gaining valuable insights into customer booking behavior within the hotel industry. Recognizing that customer demand can vary across different segments, forecasting becomes challenging, potentially necessitating distinct models for each segment. These insights serve to inform hotels in refining their customer strategies and preparing for uncertainties ahead.

Explain Briefly.
1. **Cancellation Rate Insights:**
   - The high cancellation rate of 27.52% suggests a need for measures to improve booking retention. Offering loyalty discounts can incentivize guests to maintain their bookings despite potential changes in plans, thus enhancing booking retention rates.

2. **Meal Preparation Efficiency:**
   - Guests' preference for Bed and Breakfast (BB) meals highlights the importance of efficient meal preparation to avoid delays and ensure guest satisfaction. Maintaining adequate stocks of raw materials for BB meals can minimize delays and provide prompt and satisfactory meal services.

3. **Room Availability Optimization:**
   - Longer waiting times, particularly in City Hotels, can lead to guest frustration and impact their experience negatively. Increasing the number of available rooms in City Hotels can reduce waiting times, improve guest satisfaction, and capitalize on urban accommodation demand.

4. **Targeted Marketing Strategies:**
   -  While Travel Agencies (TA) dominate bookings, diversifying the customer base beyond TA bookings is crucial. Implementing targeted marketing strategies tailored to different demographics and travel preferences can attract new guests and reduce reliance solely on travel agencies.

5. **Room Type Preferences:**
   - Guest preference for Room Type A underscores the importance of aligning room availability with demand. Increasing the availability of Room Type A can better cater to guest preferences, optimize room inventory, and maximize revenue potential.

6. **Improving Guest Retention:**
   -  Enhancing guest experiences through personalized services and loyalty programs can foster a connection with guests and encourage repeat visits, addressing the challenge of low repeated guest rates.

7. **Operational Efficiency:**
   -  City hotels face operational challenges leading to longer waiting times compared to resort hotels. Streamlining processes, leveraging technology, and optimizing staffing levels can enhance operational efficiency and guest satisfaction.
8. **Optimizing Stay Duration:**
   - Providing memorable experiences and convenient amenities within shorter stay durations can maximize guest satisfaction. Offering curated experiences and easy access to local attractions can enhance the overall guest experience during shorter stays.

9. **Targeted Demographic Focus:**
    - Developing tailored marketing and service strategies for guests from Portugal can attract and retain this demographic. This includes offering promotions, providing multilingual staff, and showcasing Portuguese culture within the hotel's offerings. Understanding and addressing the unique needs of Portuguese guests can lead to increased loyalty and positive recommendations within this demographic.
  
Conclusion

Hotels should consider implementing loyalty discounts to combat the 27.52% cancellation rate. Additionally, prioritizing advanced stocking for Bed and Breakfast meals, increasing room availability in City Hotels and diversifying promotional offers beyond Travel Agencies can optimize operations and enhance guest satisfaction, especially focusing on the preferred Room Type A and targeting guests from Portugal for tailored marketing strategies to improve retention and overall experience.
